code:
- revise scaling
- oob strategy split functions

- create node to create tree statistics
- output magnitude and direction of votes

- investigate weighting of votes of different scales
- lazy patch extraction?

entanglement:
- prob. distr. for feature selection during training (-> 2nd training needed) -> depends on tree level
- prob. distr. for feature parameters
