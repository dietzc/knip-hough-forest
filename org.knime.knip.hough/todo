code:
- investigate weighting of votes of different scales
- images used for prediction must have same format as used for learning (size of dimensions)
- missing value handling

entanglement:
- breadth first
- new features
- prob. distr. for feature selection during training (-> 2nd training needed) -> depends on tree level
- prob. distr. for feature parameters
